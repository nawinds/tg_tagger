# Telegram tagger
This is a bot for tagging admins in Telegram supergroups based on their custom title.
E.g. to tag all admins you can write one of these examples:
- /all <...>
- /t all <...>
- /group all <...>
- /t all, <...>
- /group all, <...>

If some of your admins have the same title "A room", you can try these commands to tag them:
- /t A <...>
- /group A <...>
- /t A, <...>
- /group A room <...>

If you would like to make a bot of your own, you can view and run the code in [main.py](https://github.com/nawinds/tg_tagger/blob/master/main.py) file.
